Welcome to my GitHub! Here you can find some small projects I spent my free time on, just for fun.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on:** *my job :)*
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:** *it's a secret! (plus lots of C++ with my job)*
- ðŸ‘€ **My interests:** *old languages, scripting, creating the most apparently convoluted systems to efficiently reach my goals*
- ðŸ‘» **One fun fact:** *one time I modded a modem, but in the process I deleted the whole firmware and I had to reflash it manually without any sort of guide... my old roommates still think it was due to a power outage :)*
